{ShowCharacter("Rory", "Center", "Nat")}
It’s been a long time since I’ve been to Caracosa Amusement Park. 

Filler Text 

Too far from home to go when I come back for summer break, but too close to go when I’m off at college. 

Filler Text 

I could see the lights from the train station. Has the green always reflected off the clouds like that? It looks like miasma. 

Filler Text

The lady behind the counter looked at the letter I gave her. Her eyebrows narrowed. 

Filler Text 

Rory: “I know, weird right?” 

Filler Text 

I tried to laugh it off. She asked me to buy the ticket and enjoy the last hour before the festivities were to begin. I made my way to The Hollow Castle, where the invitation had instructed us to meet. 

Filler Text 

{HideCharacter("Blank")}
The Hollow Castle had quite the history, once being an old dark ride, then a set piece for a roller coaster, then the cue building for another ride, and now just a walk through attraction that should have told the story of the Amber Crowned king. 

Filler Text 

Instead, it was just a hub for graffiti that no one bothered to clean. 

Filler Text 

I wasn’t the first one there, finding a few others scattered around the room. Who should I approach? 


Filler Text 

* The Artist 

I made my way over to the artist

Filler Text 

{ShowCharacter("Jon", "Left", "Nat")}

Filler Text 

Rory: “Wasn’t always like this. It was still a ride cue when I was here last.” 


Filler Text 

Jess: “You got a paper too?” 


Filler Text 

Sage: “I thought we were going to keep that secret.” 


Filler Text

Filler Text 

Bonnie: “So no one died?” 

Filler Text 

Hendrix: “Told you no one died.” 

Filler Text 

Rory: “If you want to talk about deaths at this park, you should see The Moat Boat.” 

Filler Text

Filler Text 

Rory: “Hey, journalists gotta make money somehow.” 

Filler Text 

Bonnie: “Have I read anything you worked on?” 

Filler Text 

Rory: “Rory Conner, I did a lot for game journals.” 

Filler Text 

Bonnie: “I’m Bonnie, and can’t say I have read much of that. The man on the floor is Warren. He drove me here.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “No, but I don’t think splitting up is a good idea either. We should travel together.” 

Filler Text

Rory: “If you’re so insistent.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “Where would you like to go?” 

* Dark Ride
	Rory: “How about Crystal Mines?” 

	Filler Text

	Elias: “lead the way. It sounds like you’ve been here more than I have.” 

	Filler Text

I wanted to ask him what he ment, but leaving the castle I found the place to be far more unsettling then I had remembered. The coastal fog hung low and silhouettes of still and silent rides made the whole park feel liminal. 

Filler Text

Our footsteps crunch on the gravel path as we turned towards the Old Town section. Colonial houses lined the thin paths, some boarded up and others with unlit store signs that swung in the slight breeze. 

Filler Text

I stopped at the entrance to the ride, the face of an old copper mine that was marked with a surprisingly well kept “Keep Out” sign. 

Filler Text

Elias was hanging back, as the gravel gave way to dirt I turned, finding he was still standing at the entrance. 

Filler Text

Rory: “You coming? You’re the one who said we shouldn’t be traveling alone.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “Is it safe down there?” 

Filler Text

Rory: “Of course. Come on.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “I don’t trust it. I’ll wait here for you if you must go exploring this place.” 

	** Explore 

Rory: “Look, you can stay up there if you want.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “Gladly.” 

Filler Text

Rory: “But then you’re going to have to deal with the racoons all by yourself.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “Racoons? Are you sure?” 

Filler Text

Rory: “Yeah, the dumpster isn't too far and they love to congrats around there.” 

Filler Text

Elias: “On second thought, let’s enjoy this ride.” 

Filler Text

The que was just as I remembered, the walls painted as false wood and peppered with notices about the mine’s safety. 

Filler Text

The dirt path sloped downward,pulling us farther from the orange glow of the light overhead. I looked to Elias who asked the question I was too uneasy to ask. 

Filler Text

Elias: “You didn’t see the lights on before, did you?” 

Filler Text

Rory: “No. Maybe they’re on a motion timer?” 

Filler Text

Elias: “I hope the rest of the ride isn’t.” 

Filler Text

Rory: “What? You’d rather walk through it?” 

Filler Text

Elias: “If you don’t mind.” 

Filler Text

So at the end of the que we made our way past the carts and traveled along the tracks into the next scene. 

Filler Text

Elias was quick, taking long strides and walking past the scene of the miner’s base camp and old man with a dead canary. He stopped at the scene of one of the miners overlooking a map as a wide cavern of crystals opened behind him. 

*** Animatronic 

	Captain: “It has to be around here somewhere.”

			The map was positioned away from the passing carts, and it was starting to eat at me what it said. 

			Rory: “Bravery fails and greed sussums.” 

			Elias looked a bit dazed, as if trying to recall something he had heard before.

							Elias: “I don’t think it’s supposed to do this.” 

							He held the crystal to his eye, squinting at the light that seemed to glow brighter before slipping it into his pocket. 

							Elias: “I can trust you to keep a secret, yes?” 

							This voice sent shivers down my spine. I nodded.

											The room was washed in a brilliant orange light and a deep melodic cackle filled the air. 

											Elias: “What in the name-” 

											Rory: “Fault fire alarm?” 

											Elias: “It would be something worth telling the others when we get out of here.”

									******* Rollar Coaster
										The Mindbender held the record for the most inversion on a coaster until the Smiler appeared at Alton Towers. 

										The black track was hard to see in the dark, but the glowing red eyes of the statue used for a head chopper effect still blazed. 

										Elias: “What even is this?” 

										Rory: “Only the most extreme coaster at the park. The que’s pretty cool too.” 

										Elias: “To think a person would ever go on this is laughable.” 

										Rory: “Not a coaster person?”

										Elias: “Can’t say I am. Look, just have your fun looking around.” 

										Rory: “At least walk through the cue with me? I promise it'll be worth it.” 

										The cue was designed like an old study, with the line snaking past tall bookshelves.  

										I would have sworn they were fake ones, but Elias picked up a leather bound book and flipped it open. 

										Elias: “Shelves of blank books?” 

										Rory: “That’s not the important part. Here, read the sigh.” 

										Elias: “Entering the tavern on a rain soaked night I found that only one patron sat at the bar. He was dressed in a tattered rain coat and hid his face from me.” 

										Rory: “Come on, the next one’s up here.” 

										Elias: “When I asked him what prompted his drink he laughed and said to me-” 

										King: “Any sane man would wish to forget what I had seen.” 

										Elias: “What is this?” 

										Rory: “The story of the ride? This is a theme park after all.” 

										Elias: “Summarize it. This feels stupid.” 

										Rory: “Why are you even here?” 

										Elias: “I could ask you the same thing.” 

										Rory: “I would tell you if you did.” 

										Elias: “Exactly why I didn’t.” 

										Rory: “Fine, the speaker here decided that despite the warning from the sailor he would go to the island and when he gets there he mind is nearly torn apart by the malevolent spirit he calls the jester until a goddess that’s not named spares him but claims his eyes as a price.” 

										Elias: “And that statue?” 

										Rory: “The goddess. Locals call her Irina.” 

										Elias: “Can we move on?” 

											** No 
												Rory: “Come on, scaredy cat. You don’t have to go on the ride if you don’t want to.” 

												I raced to the end of the cue, Elias’s footsteps chasing after me. 

												I stopped when I saw someone standing behind the control panel. 

												As I started to approach I felt a hand on my arm, Elias spoke in my ear. 

												Elias: “This is a bad idea. Let’s just look around for a moment.” 

												I nodded and took a moment to take in my surroundings.

														Their eyes were glossy, dazed, as if they’d just woken up from a nap. They also didn’t have a name tag. 

														However, it was as I looked down I realized something was wrong. Their legs were fused into the control panel. Skin melted and fuzed with wires that snaked up and plunged through their legs like valiant roots in search of food.

I turned to Elias. He shook his head. Who should I trust?

		****Attendant 

			I shook my head and made my way to the cart, taking a seat in the front, lowering the lap bar til it clicked. 

A laugh played the speaker, the laugh of a Jester. 

Jester: “I would tell you to hold on tight, but you’ve never been good at following directions normal.” 

The coaster launched and I gripped the lap bar as I was plunged onto the fastest ride of this coaster I’d ever had. 

The turns were sharp, slamming me into the side of teh cart. 

Has this coaster always had so many left turns? 

It approached Irius, her sword drawn, prepared for the train to pass between it and her other arm. 
With the glow of her eyes the only light I thought I saw her fingers twitch. 

I lowered my head and closed my eyes, being met with a loud crunch of metal before the cart plunged into the down of a hill faster then I remember. 

I turned around and found the back half of the train stuck on the other side of the track, Irius’s head having turned to face with her amber eyes. 

The cart pulled into the unloading area and I tried to pull up on the lap bar, finding it stuck. 

I kept pulling, squirming as it seemed to only get tight around me. 

The cart moved again, now in the loading area. Elias was reaching for the controls as the glassy eyed attendant was tugging on his free arm. 

Elias hit a bun and the lap bar unlaunched. 

I made a jump for the platform, just making it as the train plunged into the corset again. 

The attendant turned placid, not even blinking as his arms dropped and allowed Elias to pull away. 

Elias: “Don’t tell me you want to go anywhere else.”

“On second thought” 
* Mindway 
It took a long moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the mindway. 

The pavement pathway was lined on either side with game tents that looked ominous in the fog. 

Elias: “Isn’t this a children’s area?” 

Rory: “Don’t like plushies?” 

Elias: “Don’t see the point.” 

Rory: “So you’re clearly single.” 

Elias: “Why are we even here?” 

Rory: “There’s got to be at least one that’s open.” 

Elias: “You used to win prizes for yourself?” 

Rory: “I could have said no to traveling with you.” 

Elias: “Why didn’t you?” 
I didn’t have an answer for that, so I just forced all the empty game stalls. It wouldn’t be hard to turn on one of them, would it? 

** Water Gun 
	I approached a water gun game, letting out a laugh when I saw the collection of bat plushies that hung upside down from chains that were used to draw in commoners. 

Elias: “Would you like to play?” 

	*** Yes 
		Rory: “You know how to turn it on?” 

Elias: “Regrettably.” 

	He climbed over the counter and to the spot where the operator would stand. He cleared his throat and spoke with his best carny impression.  

	Elias: “Step right up. Step up. Best prizes on the lot here. You- come sit.” 

I couldn’t help but laugh as I took a seat, lining up the water gun. The lights and music flared to life. 

Elias: “Ready. Aim. Fire.” 

The bell sounded and the water started, it was a perfect bullseye, the water pressing the plate into the trigger that lifted a small dragon statue to the top of the tent. 

The bell sounded again and the lights flashed telling me that I had won. 

Elias: “Pick any prize little lady.” 

I laughed and pointed to one of the bats. 

Elias got it down and unceremoniously threw it to me before turning the game off. 

Rory: “Thanks.” 

Elias: “Whatever.” 

He was back to his stuck up tone, rolling his eyes. A thought crossed my mind. Maybe I should give him the bat. 

**** Give
	Rory: “catch” 

I tossed him the bat. 

Elias: “What?” 

Rory: “Though you might like it.” 

Elias: “Keep it. And maybe try to be less obvious next time you try to flirt.” 

**** Keep 
	On second thought, it was cute, and surprisingly soft for some cheap toy. 

	*** No

**** Nevermind 
	“On second thought, let’s go” 

**Shooting gallery 
My attention was drawn to a reskinned shooting gallery, but rather than fake guns they looked like crossbows. 

Rory: “You know, I’m really good at these games.” 

Elias: “You used to shoot at balloons?” 

Rory: “yeah.” 
I approached a game, observing the oversized teddy bears that lined the edges of the play area. 

Elias: “Would you like to play?” 

	*** Yes 
		Rory: “You know how to turn it on?” 

Elias: “Regrettably.” 

	He climbed over the counter and to the spot where the operator would stand. He cleared his throat and spoke with his best carny impression.  

	Elias: “Step right up. Step up. Best prizes on the lot here. You- step and choose your weapon.” 

I couldn’t help but laugh as I picked up the crossbow, a few lights turned on so I could see the target. 

Elias: “Three shots. All three hit the star, any prize on the wall. Whenever you’re ready.” 

He stepped to the side as I held up the cross boy and ook in a long breath. 

I closed one eye and adjusted my aim. I fired once. Twice. Three times. All three perfect hits. 

Elias: “Impressive, take your prize.” 

He hunted the bear onto the counter and I took it. It had large golden eyes and a smile that was infectious. 

He was back to his stuck up tone, rolling his eyes. A thought crossed my mind. Maybe I should give him the bear. 
 
****Give 
	Rory: “Hey, this is a bit big for me to hold.” 

Elias: “I:m not carrying around your damn teddy bear.” 

Rory: “What if it was your damn teddy bear?” 

He held the oversized plush out to him and he took it. 

Elias: “Don’t think I’ll be telling people how we got this.” 

Rory: “wouldn’t ask you to.” 

****Keep 
	Or not. Maybe he would think I was flirting.

	** Horse Race 
	I approached the horse race game, smiling to myself as I took in the theming. Rather than the horses painted like the horse racing sports, it alternated between knights and rogues. 

I took a seat at one of the rouge’s spots, studying the length of the lane and the size of the holes at the end as Elias turned on the game and set up my lane and another lane for the knights. 

Elias: “It’s no fun without some competition.” 

The balls appeared in the basket at the bottom and we both rushed to land the balls into the holes. 

When the lights flashed and the bell sounded I looked to the horses, the knight had won. 

Elias: “Seems you’re not very good at this.” 

Rory: “You’re the one who called them kiddy games.” 

Elias: “Sometimes people had weird skills.” 

He picked up a brown wolf push and tossed it to me. 

Rory: “You won, shouldn’t you keep it?” 

Elias: “You’re right that I'm single.” 

He started walking away, leaving me to chase after him. 

									******* Mindway

					***** Fire Alarm 
					Looking out to the track from here I could see a fire alarm I couldn't see before. I looked to Elias who seemed more fascinated with the crystals before walking over and giving it a pull. 

					There was no alarm. 

					The room was washed in a brilliant orange light and a deep melodic cackle filled the air. 

					Elias: “What in the name-” 

					Rory: “Fault fire alarm?” 

					Elias: “It would be something worth telling the others when we get out of here.” 


					***** Key 
						Near the foot of the animatronic colloquial known as the captain was a key. I picked it up almost without thinking. It wasn’t attached to anything and I slipped it into my camera bag hopefully before Elias had taken notice.

		**** Doors
			The doors shouldn’t have been opened, after all it should be a trigger with the carts crossing a part of the track. I took a few uneasy steps closer, the parting bits of stone decorated with a bright yellow chalk. Maybe this ride was also hit with some graffiti. 

		**** Crystals 
			The crystals had a soft internal glow, almost like they were LED lights. 

			That was proven wrong when Elias slammed the edges of his book into the wall and broke off a small piece of crystal. 

			Elias: “I don’t think it’s supposed to do this.” 

			He held the crystal to his eye, squinting at the light that seemed to glow brighter before slipping it into his pocket. 

			Elias: “I can trust you to keep a secret, yes?” 

			This voice sent shivers down my spine. I nodded.

*** Map 
The map was positioned away from the passing carts, and it was starting to eat at me what it said. 
Rory: “Bravery fails and greed sussums.” 

Elias looked a bit dazed, as if trying to recall something he had heard before.

	Elias: “Glad to see you have some common sense. Is there somewhere else you’d rather go?” 

	*** Roller Coaster
		*** Midway
	*** Nevermind 
* Roller Coaster 
The Mindbender held the record for the most inversion on a coaster until the Smiler appeared at Alton Towers. 

The black track was hard to see in the dark, but the glowing red eyes of the statue used for a head chopper effect still blazed. 

Elias: “What even is this?” 

Rory: “Only the most extreme coaster at the park. The que’s pretty cool too.” 

Elias: “To think a person would ever go on this is laughable.” 

Rory: “Not a coaster person?”

Elias: “Can’t say I am. Look, just have your fun looking around.” 

Rory: “At least walk through the cue with me? I promise it'll be worth it.” 

The cue was designed like an old study, with the line snaking past tall bookshelves.  

I would have sworn they were fake ones, but Elias picked up a leather bound book and flipped it open. 

Elias: “Shelves of blank books?” 

Rory: “That’s not the important part. Here, read the sigh.” 
Elias: “Entering the tavern on a rain soaked night I found that only one patron sat at the bar. He was dressed in a tattered rain coat and hid his face from me.” 
Rory: “Come on, the next one’s up here.” 

Elias: “When I asked him what prompted his drink he laughed and said to me-” 

King: “Any sane man would wish to forget what I had seen.” 

Elias: “What is this?” 

Rory: “The story of the ride? This is a theme park after all.” 

Elias: “Summarize it. This feels stupid.” 

Rory: “Why are you even here?” 

Elias: “I could ask you the same thing.” 

Rory: “I would tell you if you did.” 

Elias: “Exactly why I didn’t.” 

Rory: “Fine, the speaker here decided that despite the warning from the sailor he would go to the island and when he gets there he mind is nearly torn apart by the malevolent spirit he calls the jester until a goddess that’s not named spares him but claims his eyes as a price.” 

Elias: “And that statue?” 
Rory: “The goddess. Locals call her Irina.” 

Elias: “Can we move on?” 

** No 
Rory: “Come on, scaredy cat. You don’t have to go on the ride if you don’t want to.” 

I raced to the end of the cue, Elias’s footsteps chasing after me. 

I stopped when I saw someone standing behind the control panel. 

As I started to approach I felt a hand on my arm, Elias spoke in my ear. 

Elias: “This is a bad idea. Let’s just look around for a moment.” 

I nodded and took a moment to take in my surroundings. 

*** Attendant 

The attent wa dressed in the classic uniform, a dull yellow shirt with a black turtleneck underneath it. 

Their eyes were glossy, dazed, as if they’d just woken up from a nap. They also didn’t have a name tag. 

However, it was as I looked down I realized something was wrong. Their legs were fused into the control panel. Skin melted and fuzed with wires that snaked up and plunged through their legs like valiant roots in search of food. 

	*** Camera 
A camara sat in the rafters, the redlight soft but flickering at regular intervals that drew the eye. 


	*** Candles 
	The LED candles seemed to flickr here more than I remembered. They looked like real candles, even having small plumes of smoke. 

*** Tape Recorder 
	Positioned on the track was a tape recorder. I steadily made my way over, keeping to the shadow. 

*** Bag 
	Inside the coaster car was a backpack. It was likely once a vibrant green and was now caked with dirt and ripped in places. 

I inched my way closer, but passed into view of the attendant. 

Attendant: “Take your seats, the ride will soon depart.” 

I snatched the bag and returned to the shadows, fully the eyes of the attendant not following. 
The attendant turned to us, speaking almost robotically. 
			
			Attendant: “Please take your seats. We don’t have much time. The goddess demands payment. Your blood will do nicely.”

I turned to Elias. He shook his head. Who should I trust? 
		**** Elias 
			I nodded to Elias and we made our way outside.  

		****Attendant 

			I shook my head and made my way to the cart, taking a seat in the front, lowering the lap bar til it clicked. 

A laugh played the speaker, the laugh of a Jester. 

Jester: “I would tell you to hold on tight, but you’ve never been good at following directions normal.” 

The coaster launched and I gripped the lap bar as I was plunged onto the fastest ride of this coaster I’d ever had. 

The turns were sharp, slamming me into the side of teh cart. 

Has this coaster always had so many left turns? 

It approached Irius, her sword drawn, prepared for the train to pass between it and her other arm. 
With the glow of her eyes the only light I thought I saw her fingers twitch. 

I lowered my head and closed my eyes, being met with a loud crunch of metal before the cart plunged into the down of a hill faster then I remember. 

I turned around and found the back half of the train stuck on the other side of the track, Irius’s head having turned to face with her amber eyes. 

The cart pulled into the unloading area and I tried to pull up on the lap bar, finding it stuck. 

I kept pulling, squirming as it seemed to only get tight around me. 

The cart moved again, now in the loading area. Elias was reaching for the controls as the glassy eyed attendant was tugging on his free arm. 

Elias hit a bun and the lap bar unlaunched. 

I made a jump for the platform, just making it as the train plunged into the corset again.

Rory: “Don’t like plushies?” 

Elias: “Don’t see the point.”
